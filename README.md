# Checking-Stationarity-of-Air-Quality-Dataset
Stationarity of time series dataset is checked.

A stationary time series is the one for which the properties (namely mean, variance and covariance) do not depend on time. 

It is easy to generate a forcasting model for stationary dataset.

The dataset used is a time-series data. The dataset under consideration consists of four main pollutants viz, NO2, SO2, SPM and RSPM. It contains daily concentrations of the aforementioned pollutants from 2008-2010.
